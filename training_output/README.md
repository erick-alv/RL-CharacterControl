# Training output
 Here we share the resulst of our training. Please find the files in the following link https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fi6vrL9FpeSM2hbzySDrnw/datasets_files . Each of our training runs produced a directory with a name 'HumanoidImitation_DD-MM-hh-mm-ss' with the respective time of creation. Each folder has a folder 'nn', a folder 'summaries' and a file 'run_config.yaml'. 'nn' contains the checkpoints for the weights of the neural network. 'summaries' has the logs of tensorboard. 'run_config.yaml' describes which training configuration we used.

 To make clear which training configuration corresponds to which fold, here we give a list. Please, take into consideration that sometimes we had to stop the training and then resume it later. Therefore, some configurations have more than one folder assigned
