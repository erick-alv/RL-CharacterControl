# Results of: Different Training Configurations

- [This video]() shows a ... motion from the ... set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were ... . Here we compare the results of ... in row 2.. against ... in row 3..
- [This video](rew_rt1_vs_rt2_sync_max.mp4) shows a motion of walking from the Basic_ES set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were the ParSet2 parameter set, torque control and 36Hz step frequency. Here we compare the results of r<sub>t,1</sub> in row 2 against r<sub>t,2</sub> in row 3.
- [This video](control_to_vs_pd_sync_max.mp4) shows a of a standing motion from the Basic_ES set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were ParSet2 parameter set, r<sub>t,2</sub> reward and 36Hz step frequency. Here we compare the results of control with torque in row 2 against PD-control in row 3.
- [This video](bandai_que_vs_alt_altbetter_sync_max.mp4) shows a running motion from the Basic_ES set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were PD-control, r<sub>t,2</sub> reward and 36Hz step frequency. Here we compare the results of ParSet1 in row 2 against ParSet2 in row 3.
- [This video](lafan_que_vs_alt_quebetter_sync_max_dch.mp4) shows a running motion from the LAFAN_ES set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were PD-control, r<sub>t,2</sub> reward and 36Hz step frequency. Here we compare the results of ParSet1 in row 2 against ParSet2 in row 3.
- [This video](diff_rt2_alt_to_36_vs_72sync_max_dch.mp4) shows a running motion from the LAFAN_ES set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were torques control, r<sub>t,2</sub> reward and ParSet2. Here we compare the results of 36Hz in row 2 against 72Hz in row 3.
- [This video](sim_rt2_alt_pd_36_vs_72sync_max_dch.mp4) shows a running motion from the LAFAN_ES set in the first row. The common training parameters for the agents were PD-control, r<sub>t,2</sub> reward and ParSet2. Here we compare the results of 36Hz in row 2 against 72Hz in row 3.
